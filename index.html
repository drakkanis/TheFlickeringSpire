<h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-ember-500" style="color: #f0a44b;">The Setting</h2>
<p class="text-gray-300">The Sablewood is an ancient, expansive forest, older than memory, where the canopy is so thick that day and night are often indistinguishable. It is a land of vibrant life, home to unique hybrid fauna and reclusive communities. To maintain a fragile peace, great Spires of stone were erected, tended by solitary Keepers whose life force is tied to the magical flames they protect. These beacons ward the forest against a creeping, mindless blight and pacify the more monstrous creatures that lurk in the shadows.</p>
</section>
<section class="mb-12 p-6 bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg border border-gray-700 scroll-mt-20" id="threat" style="background-color: rgba(31, 41, 55, 0.5); border-color: #273036;">
<h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-ember-500" style="color: #f0a44b;">The Threat</h2>
<p class="text-gray-300">A subtle corruption has begun to seep into the Sablewood. It is a formless, insidious blight that preys on weakness and amplifies despair. It twists the natural life of the forest, turning creatures into pained, aggressive versions of themselves. This blight originates from a source of chaotic, uncontrolled magic, and it spreads through contact and proximity, threatening to unravel the ancient wards that have long protected the forest.</p>
</section>
<section class="mb-12 p-6 bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg border border-gray-700 scroll-mt-20" id="developments" style="background-color: rgba(31, 41, 55, 0.5); border-color: #273036;">
<h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-ember-500" style="color: #f0a44b;">Recent Developments</h2>
<p class="text-gray-300">A powerful surge of raw, untamed magic recently washed through the Sablewood. The source was unknown to Elara, the keeper of the western Spire. Fearing the surge would overwhelm her Spire's wards, she attempted a dangerous attunement ritual. The power was too great. The ritual backfired, shattering her defenses and allowing the latent corruption to pour into her. She is no longer the Spire's guardian but its prisoner, a vessel for the very blight she sought to defy.</p>

<h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-ember-500" style="color: #f0a44b;">Adventure Summary</h2>
<p class="text-gray-300">The adventure begins when the Whitefire Arcanist, concerned about a weakening Spire, tasks the PCs with investigating its failing flame. Their journey will take them along the Sablewood Path where they will encounter signs of the spreading corruption. They will discover the blighted hamlet of Ashen and learn of the Spirekeeper's fate before navigating the mystical Miremist to reach the Spire itself. After ascending the crumbling tower, they will face the corrupted Spirekeeper, Elara, with the choice to either cleanse her and the Spire or destroy the vessel she has become to stop the blight's spread.</p>

<h3 class="font-display text-xl font-bold text-ember-400 mb-2" style="color: #fbbf24;">1. The Underroot Connection</h3>
<p>You grew up in an Underroot community and have a deep connection to the Sablewood's health. You've felt a "sickness" in the roots and heard whispers from your kin that the surface world is falling out of balance. The dimming of a Spire is a dire omen you feel compelled to investigate.</p>

<div class="p-6 bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg border border-gray-700" style="background-color: rgba(31, 41, 55, 0.5); border-color: #273036;">
<h3 class="font-display text-xl font-bold text-ember-400 mb-2" style="color: #fbbf24;">2. A Merchant's Debt</h3>
<p>You are a member of, or have a significant debt to, the Sable Sinecure merchant's guild. The increasing aggression of the forest's hybrid fauna is making the well-worn pathways unsafe, disrupting trade. The guild has put out a bounty for anyone who can discover the source of the recent animal agitation and "pacify" it.</p>

<h3 class="font-display text-xl font-bold text-ember-400 mb-2" style="color: #fbbf24;">3. Spire-Sworn Lineage</h3>
<p>One of your ancestors was a Spirekeeper. Though you never knew them, you carry a small, inert warding totem. For the past week, it has begun to feel warm and pulse with a faint, sickly light. You feel a pull towards the west, an instinctual call to answer a distress you don't yet understand.</p>

<p class="text-gray-300">With Elara either cleansed or laid to rest, the immediate threat to the western Sablewood has passed.</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-4">
<li><strong>If Elara was Cleansed:</strong> The Spire's flame roars back to life, a brilliant, steady beacon. The corruption in the immediate area recedes over the next few days. The villagers of Ashen slowly recover, and the forest's fauna returns to a less aggressive state. Elara, once she recovers, is immensely grateful and becomes a powerful ally to the party. She will confirm that the surge of magic felt overwhelming and unnatural, providing a hook for a future adventure to find its source.</li>
<li><strong>If Elara was Destroyed:</strong> The flame is extinguished completely, and the Spire goes dark. The blighted ground around its base remains, a permanent scar on the landscape. While the party has stopped the immediate threat, the region is now vulnerable, and the corruption may one day return. The party has the gratitude of the people of Ashen, but a shadow of failure and loss hangs over their victory. This could lead to a future quest to find a new Spirekeeper or a way to relight the flame.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mt-4 text-gray-300">In either case, the party has earned a reputation as heroes in the Sablewood, and the Whitefire Arcanist will be keen to hear of their deeds and perhaps offer them a new, more dangerous task.</p>

The Spires are immensely powerful, but also delicate. It could be a failure in the warding stones, sickness, or… something worse. The Keepers are solitary. If Elara—that's her name—is in trouble, she has no one to call for aid. The flame is a reflection of her own life force. As it dims, so does she."<br><strong>Knowledge (Recall) check (DC 12):</strong> A character succeeding on this check remembers that Spire flames are also tied to the ambient magic of the region. A great surge of power, either benevolent or malevolent, could destabilize one if the Keeper wasn't prepared.</li>
                    <li><strong>"What will we find in the west? What are the perils?"</strong><br><strong>Whitefire Arcanist's Answer:</strong> "The paths are well-worn, for the most part. You'll pass near the Miremist hollow, a place known for its perpetual, disorienting fog. The 'Lucy,' the Lucent River, feeds that area, and its moonglow can play tricks on the eyes. As for creatures... well, it's the Sablewood. Strixwolves hunt in packs, and I've heard tales of Mountain Crabs camouflaged so well they're mistaken for rockfall until it's too late. Stick to the path, and you *should* be fine."<br><strong>Instinct (Sense) check (DC 12):</strong> A successful check allows a character to press the Whitefire Arcanist on her hesitation. She'll admit, "There are whispers among the traders of things being... wrong. Hybrid fauna growing more aggressive, larger. It's why I'm so worried. The Spires are meant to keep that in check."</li>
                    <li><strong>"Are there any points of interest or people we should know about?"</strong><br><strong>Whitefire Arcanist's Answer:</strong> "My map marks a small hamlet, Ashen. It's new, settled only a few years ago by families who thought the Spire's protection was enough. I don't know them well. Be cautious; small communities can be… insular. There's also an old circle of standing stones near the Miremist. They predate the Spires, dedicated to the Forgotten Gods. They might hold some clue."<br><strong>Presence (Persuade) check (DC 13):</strong> A successful check to ask for a contact might yield a quip. The Whitefire Arcanist will sigh, rubbing her temples. "Friendliness is a high price out here. But look, if you see a merchant named <strong>Will Scild</strong>, tell him the Whitefire Arcanist sent you. He's an old Galapa, drier than a year-old stump, but fair. He values his wood wage more than gold, so don't try to haggle. Just... don't touch the small stone he's always tossing between his hands.

                    <li><strong>"The Whitefire Arcanist sent us."</strong> — <strong>Will's Answer:</strong> He'll stop tossing the stone and give the party a long look. "Did she now? She still owes me for that bundle of whisper-vine. If you're fixing her problems, that's your wood wage to earn. Be warned: the forest feels wrong. The animals are agitated. Even the silence has teeth."</li>

                <p>The puzzle is to correctly align the five wardstones. Each stone is carved with a different Sablewood constellation: <strong>The Strixwolf</strong>, <strong>The Spire</strong>, <strong>The River Serpent</strong>, <strong>The Bullfrog</strong>, and <strong>The Great Root</strong>. The stones can be rotated. The goal is to orient each stone's carving to point towards its corresponding constellation in the sky, but the Miremist obscures the stars. A successful <strong>Instinct (Study) check (DC 12)</strong> on the stones reveals faint magical lines on the ground, forming a partial map of the sky. The solution requires the party to piece together the celestial map and align all five stones correctly. A successful alignment causes the stones to hum with power, parting the mist and revealing the path forward. Failing a check to align a stone ticks the "Lost in the Mire" countdown.</p>

                        <li><strong>Roleplaying:</strong> Emphasize Elara's torment. She is a victim, not a willing villain. Her dialogue should be pained and her attacks desperate, reinforcing the tragic nature of the encounter.</li>

                 <blockquote class="read-aloud p-4 my-4">The wind whips across the top of the Spire. In the center of the circular platform, a woman kneels. Veins of pulsing, black energy crawl across her skin. She looks up, her face a mask of pure anguish. “You should not be here,” she rasps, her voice a discordant harmony. “It’s... too much. I can’t... hold it.” The flame in the brazier behind her shrinks to a spark, and the light in her eyes is consumed by darkness. As she rises, a hulking stone construct animates beside her, and spectral forms peel away from her body.</blockquote>
                <p><strong>Short locale description:</strong> A circular, open-air stone platform at the summit of the Spire. A large, ornate brazier sits in the center, containing the dying flame.</p>

                    <li><strong>Elara, the Spirekeeper:</strong> Elara is a desperate and powerful adversary focused on preventing her own cleansing. She will use her <strong>Relentless (3)</strong> feature to its full potential, taking multiple actions to pressure the party. Her primary goal is to stop anyone attempting the <strong>Cleanse the Spire</strong> ritual at the brazier, using her <strong>Shatter Focus</strong> action to disrupt them. She will use <strong>Blighted Ground</strong> to create hazardous zones, cutting off safe paths to the brazier or trapping characters. The <strong>Seeping Desperation</strong> passive will drain the party's Hope on their failures, while her <strong>Momentum</strong> reaction will fuel her abilities with Fear. The GM should use her high mobility and multiple actions to constantly harass the characters at the brazier, forcing the rest of the party to draw her attention.</li>
