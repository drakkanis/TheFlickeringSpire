                <div class="block-content"><p>Welcome to the Daggerheart™ fantasy tabletop roleplaying game! This adventure is designed to entertain you and your friends for hours with heroic deeds and harrowing perils. You, the Game Master (GM), will guide your friends as they explore the ancient Sablewood, banter with its strange denizens, and defeat vicious monsters with sword, spell, and Valor. Together, the player characters (PCs) can work to thwart an insidious corruption, winning great treasure and a heroic reputation.</p></div>

                <summary><h2>The Setting</h2></summary>
                <div class="block-content"><p>The Sablewood is an ancient, expansive forest, older than memory, where the canopy is so thick that day and night are often indistinguishable. It is a land of vibrant life, home to unique hybrid fauna and reclusive communities who live within the safety of its massive roots or high among its branches. To maintain a fragile peace, great Spires of stone were erected, tended by solitary Keepers whose life force is tied to the magical flames they protect. These beacons ward the forest against a creeping, mindless blight and pacify the more monstrous creatures that lurk in the shadows, ensuring the Sablewood remains a place of serene, if dangerous, beauty. If only that were true.</p></div>
            </details>

            <section id="the-threat" class="block"><summary><h2>The Threat</h2></summary><div class="block-content"><p>A subtle corruption has begun to seep into the Sablewood. It is not an invading army, but a formless, insidious blight that preys on weakness and amplifies despair. It twists the natural life of the forest, turning creatures into pained, aggressive versions of themselves and causing the very land to sicken. This blight likely originates from a source of chaotic, uncontrolled magic, and it seeks out conduits—beings of great power or emotion—to anchor itself in the world. Having found a foothold, it spreads through contact and proximity, threatening to unravel the ancient wards that have long protected the forest. If it is not stopped, the Spires will fall one by one, and the Sablewood will be consumed.</p></div></section>
            <section id="recent-developments" class="block"><summary><h2>Recent Developments</h2></summary><div class="block-content"><p>A powerful surge of raw, untamed magic recently washed through the Sablewood. The source was unknown to Elara, the keeper of the western Spire. Fearing the surge would overwhelm her Spire's wards, she attempted a dangerous attunement ritual, seeking to become a conduit to absorb and control the excess energy. The power was too great. The ritual backfired, shattering her defenses and allowing the latent corruption to pour into her. She is no longer the Spire's guardian but its prisoner, a vessel for the very blight she sought to defy, and the Spire's flame now flickers in time with her fading will.</p></div></section>
            <section id="adventure-summary" class="block"><summary><h2>Adventure Summary</h2></summary><div class="block-content"><p>The adventure begins when the Arcanist Astra, concerned about a weakening Spire, tasks the PCs with investigating its failing flame. Their journey will take them along the Sablewood Path where they will encounter signs of the spreading corruption. They will discover the blighted hamlet of Grey-Elm and learn of the Spirekeeper's fate before navigating the mystical Miremist to reach the Spire itself. After ascending the crumbling tower, they will face the corrupted Spirekeeper, Elara, with the choice to either cleanse her and the Spire or destroy the vessel she has become to stop the blight's spread.</p></div></section>
            <section id="adventure-hooks" class="block"><summary><h2>Adventure Hooks</h2></summary><div class="block-content"><ol><li><strong>The Underroot Connection:</strong> You grew up in an Underroot community and have a deep connection to the Sablewood's health. You've felt a "sickness" in the roots and heard whispers from your kin that the surface world is falling out of balance. The dimming of a Spire is a dire omen you feel compelled to investigate.</li><li><strong>A Merchant's Debt (Sable Sinecure):</strong> You are a member of, or have a significant debt to, the Sable Sinecure merchant's guild. The increasing aggression of the forest's hybrid fauna is making the well-worn pathways unsafe, disrupting trade. The guild has put out a bounty for anyone who can discover the source of the recent animal agitation and "pacify" it. The dimming Spire is the most likely culprit.</li><li><strong>Spire-Sworn Lineage:</strong> One of your ancestors was a Spirekeeper. Though you never knew them, you carry a small, inert warding totem passed down through your family. For the past week, it has begun to feel warm and pulse with a faint, sickly light. You feel a pull towards the west, an instinctual call to answer a distress you don't yet understand.</li></ol></div></section>

                        <div class="block-content"><h4>Subtitle: Setup</h4><p>The characters have just returned to the Arcanist Astra’s home. She has offered them rest before asking this one last favor. She is tired but clearly worried, gesturing to a hand-drawn map.</p><p><strong>Encounter/NPCs/Monsters overview:</strong> This is a social roleplaying scene with the Arcanist Astra.</p><blockquote>The scent of savory stew and cedarwood smoke fills Astra’s cozy, circular home. Outside, the endless canopy of the Sablewood is settling into twilight. Astra unrolls a leather map, its edges worn from use. Upon it, a path is marked in charcoal, leading from her home to a drawing of a single, tall spire. “The journey isn’t long, but the woods can be... deceptive,” she says, her finger tracing the route. “I don’t know what you’ll find. Just... be careful. The Spirekeepers are the heart of this forest. If one falls, a shadow falls with them.”<button class="copy-btn gm-only" aria-label="Copy read-aloud text">Copy</button></blockquote><p><strong>Short locale description:</strong> Astra's home is a cozy, circular cottage filled with books, arcane tools, and the comforting smell of a hearth. It serves as a brief sanctuary before the journey.</p><h4>Roleplaying with Astra:</h4><ul><li><p><strong>"What could have happened to the Spire?"</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Astra's Answer:</strong> "I can't be certain. The Spires are immensely powerful, but also delicate. It could be a failure in the warding stones, sickness, or… something worse. The Keepers are solitary. If Elara—that's her name—is in trouble, she has no one to call for aid. The flame is a reflection of her own life force. As it dims, so does she."</li><li><strong>Knowledge (Recall) check (DC 12):</strong> A character succeeding on this check remembers that Spire flames are also tied to the ambient magic of the region. A great surge of power, either benevolent or malevolent, could destabilize one if the Keeper wasn't prepared.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>"What will we find in the west? What are the perils?"</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Astra's Answer:</strong> "The paths are well-worn, for the most part. You'll pass near the Miremist hollow, a place known for its perpetual, disorienting fog. The 'Lucy,' the Lucent River, feeds that area, and its moonglow can play tricks on the eyes. As for creatures... well, it's the Sablewood. Strixwolves hunt in packs, and I've heard tales of Mountain Crabs camouflaged so well they're mistaken for rockfall until it's too late. Stick to the path, and you *should* be fine."</li><li><strong>Instinct (Sense) check (DC 12):</strong> A successful check allows a character to press Astra on her hesitation. She'll admit, "There are whispers among the traders of things being... wrong. Hybrid fauna growing more aggressive, larger. It's why I'm so worried. The Spires are meant to keep that in check."</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>"Are there any points of interest or people we should know about?"</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Astra's Answer:</strong> "My map marks a small hamlet, Grey-Elm. It's new, settled only a few years ago by families who thought the Spire's protection was enough. I don't know them well. Be cautious; small communities can be… insular. There's also an old circle of standing stones near the Miremist. They predate the Spires, dedicated to the Forgotten Gods. They might hold some clue."</li><li><strong>Presence (Persuade) check (DC 13):</strong> A successful check to ask for a contact might yield a quip. Astra will sigh, rubbing her temples. "Friendliness is a high price out here. But look, if you see a merchant named **Will Scild**, tell him Astra sent you. He's an old Galapa, drier than a year-old stump, but fair. He values his wood wage more than gold, so don't try to haggle. Just... don't touch the small stone he's always tossing between his hands. Trust me on that."</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Subtitle: Features of the Area</h4><ul><li><strong>Illumination:</strong> Warm, flickering candlelight.</li><li><strong>Treasure:</strong> Astra provides the party with two **Soothing Poultices** and two of **Astra's Healing Draughts** before they depart.</li></ul></div>

                        <div class="block-content"><h4>Subtitle: Setup</h4><p>The party sets off west. The path forward splits: one is a well-worn trade route, the other a less-traveled animal trail that cuts closer to a series of swampy pools.</p><p><strong>Encounter/NPCs/Monsters overview:</strong> This beat presents a choice between a social encounter with **Will Scild** or a combat encounter with a **Corrupted Bullfrog Juggernaut**.</p><blockquote>The air under the canopy is thick and humid, alive with the drone of insects. You follow Astra’s map for an hour before reaching a fork. The main path, wide enough for a cart, continues northwest, sunken into the rich soil. A smaller, muddier trail branches directly west, marked by clawed-up trees and smelling of damp earth and decay. Both paths seem to lead toward the Spire.<button class="copy-btn gm-only" aria-label="Copy read-aloud text">Copy</button></blockquote><p><strong>Short locale description:</strong> A fork in a deeply worn path under the thick, sun-blocking canopy of the Sablewood. One path is wide and safe, the other is narrow, muddy, and leads into a swampy bog.</p><h5>Option 1: The Trade Route (Social Encounter)</h5><blockquote>The path is quiet, the silence broken only by the creak of distant cart wheels. Ahead, you spot a lone figure beside a small, sturdy cart pulled by a pair of stout horse-goats. He is a Galapa of indeterminate age, slowly polishing a small, smooth stone he tosses between his hands.<button class="copy-btn gm-only" aria-label="Copy read-aloud text">Copy</button></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Roleplaying with Will Scild:</strong> Will is unphased and direct. He's not unfriendly, but he won't waste words. He'll confirm he just came from the west.<ul><li><strong>"Did you see anything unusual near the Spire?"</strong> — **Will's Answer:** "Unusual is the usual in the Sablewood. But yes. The lights in Grey-Elm are... nervous. They blink. The Spire's own flame is a guttering candle in a gale. Something's wrong. Bad for business."</li><li><strong>"Astra sent us."</strong> — **Will's Answer:** He'll stop tossing the stone and give the party a long look. "Did she now? She still owes me for that bundle of whisper-vine. If you're fixing her problems, that's your wood wage to earn. Be warned: the forest feels wrong. The animals are agitated. Even the silence has teeth."</li><li><strong>The Clue:</strong> He provides the **(Flex Clue)** about the flickering lights in Grey-Elm. A successful **Presence (Connect) check (DC 12)** gets him to add that the Strixwolf howls have sounded more pained than hungry lately. The GM can spend a Fear to use Will's **Merchant +2** Experience to increase the Difficulty if the party is being disrespectful or pushy.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Option 2: The Animal Trail (Combat Encounter)</h5><blockquote>The muddy trail opens into a clearing filled with stagnant, knee-deep pools of water shrouded in thin wisps of fog. The air is heavy with the smell of wet decay. Dozens of large, flat lily pads cover the surface of the water, and a low, guttural croak echoes across the clearing. Suddenly, the water erupts as a massive, bull-sized amphibian with mottled, ashen skin and wickedly sharp horns launches itself from a pool.<button class="copy-btn gm-only" aria-label="Copy read-aloud text">Copy</button></blockquote><ul><li><strong>The Clue:</strong> After the combat, the party finds the trail again. Here they discover the **(Flex Clue)**: Strixwolf tracks, deeper than usual, with flecks of strange, warped stone in the claw marks.</li></ul><h4>Subtitle: Tactics</h4><ul class="gm-only"><li><strong>Corrupted Bullfrog Juggernaut:</strong> The bullfrog uses its mobility to its advantage, leaping from pool to pool between attacks.

                        <div class="block-content"><h4>Ashen — Hamlet, Population 42</h4><p>A small, isolated hamlet of timber and fieldstone houses clustered around a central, now-dry well. Founded only a few years ago, the settlers rely on the protection of the nearby Spire, but a creeping blight has instilled a deep sense of fear and paranoia in the populace. The air is cold and carries a faint scent of ozone and dust.</p><ul><li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Elder Kaelen, a weary but once-wise man, informally leads the community. However, his authority is now challenged by younger, more fearful residents like Jorn.</li><li><strong>Demographics:</strong> Primarily humans, with a few scattered fauns and halflings who sought a quiet life. Most are families of farmers, woodcutters, and trappers.</li><li><strong>Economics:</strong> The hamlet survives on subsistence farming and trade with passing merchants, like Will Scild, for essential goods.</li><li><strong>Locales:</strong><ul><li><strong>The Dry Well:</strong> The central square of the hamlet.</li><li><strong>Family Homes:</strong> Simple, single-room homes of timber and stone, most with their doors and windows now barred.</li><li><strong>Elara's Hut:</strong> A small, slightly isolated hut on the edge of town where the Spirekeeper stayed when visiting.</li><li><strong>Makeshift Palisade:</strong> A poorly maintained wooden fence on the western edge of the hamlet, meant more as a deterrent to animals than a true fortification.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Subtitle: Setup</h4><p>The party arrives at the quiet hamlet of Grey-Elm (now referred to as Ashen). A thin, greyish sap weeps from the trees, and the few lanterns burning are weak and sputtering.</p><p><strong>Encounter/NPCs/Monsters overview:</strong> This is primarily a social investigation scene with the potential for combat against paranoid **Blighted Villagers**.</p><blockquote>The hamlet of Grey-Elm is deathly still. Houses of timber and fieldstone are clustered around a dry well. Grey, flaky dust coats every surface, and the trees weep a thick, ashen sap. A few villagers watch you from darkened doorways, their faces pale and drawn, their eyes wide with fear and suspicion.<button class="copy-btn gm-only" aria-label="Copy read-aloud text">Copy</button></blockquote><p><strong>Short locale description:</strong> A small, deathly quiet village. The main features are the central dry well, the small timber houses, and the palpable sense of fear.</p><ul class="gm-only"><li><strong>GM Notes:</strong><ul><li><strong>Countdown:</strong> Begin a **Consequence Countdown (4) "Hamlet's Paranoia."** This ticks down when the party fails social rolls, rolls with Fear, or uses magic aggressively. When it triggers, Jorn and 3 **Blighted Villagers** attack.</li><li><strong>Finding the Clue:</strong> The **Core Clue** (Elara's ritual) can be found via:<ul><li><strong>Social:</strong> A **Presence (Connect) check (DC 12)** with the elder, Kaelen. On a failure with Fear, tick the countdown by 2.</li><li><strong>Investigation:</strong> A **Knowledge (Investigate) check (DC 13)** in Elara's abandoned hut reveals notes on a "new warding ritual."</li></ul></li><li><strong>The Catalyst:</strong> A paranoid villager named Jorn watches the party. Failed rolls or Fear spends describe him whispering to others, advancing the countdown.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Subtitle: Features of the Area</h4><ul><li><strong>Illumination:</strong> Weak, flickering lantern-light provides dim illumination throughout the hamlet.</li><li><strong>Ashen Sap:</strong> The trees weep a thick, grey sap that is cold to the touch and smells faintly of ozone.</li><li><strong>Cover:</strong> The houses and the central well provide cover.</li></ul><h4>Stat Blocks Section</h4><div class="stat-block gm-only">{{stat block for Blighted Villager}}<button class="copy-btn" aria-label="Copy stat block as markdown">Copy as Markdown</button></div></div>

The blighted ground around its base remains, a permanent scar on the landscape. While the party has stopped the immediate threat, the region is now vulnerable, and the corruption may one day return. The party has the gratitude of the people of Ashen, but a shadow of failure and loss hangs over their victory. This could lead to a future quest to find a new Spirekeeper or a way to relight the flame.</li></ul><p>In either case, the party has earned a reputation as heroes in the Sablewood, and the Arcanist Astra will be keen to hear of their deeds and perhaps offer them a new, more dangerous task.</p></div>
