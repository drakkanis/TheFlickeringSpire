# TheFlickeringSpire

Digital toolkit and print-ready versions of "The Flickering Spire," a Daggerheart one-shot adventure.

A light falters in the ancient Sablewood, and a creeping blight follows in the growing darkness. The magical Spires that protect the forest are weakening, and one is on the verge of failing completely. Heroes are called to venture into a land of hybrid beasts and forgotten magic, investigate a hamlet succumbing to a strange illness, navigate treacherous paths, and confront the tragedy at the heart of the crumbling Spire
